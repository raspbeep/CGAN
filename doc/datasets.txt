Datasets Used for Sketch-to-Face Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation

1. Selfie2anime Dataset
Description: 
- The selfie dataset contains 3400 female selfie images for training and 100 images for validation, 
  with the image size of 256 x 256. The anime dataset contains 3400 female character images 
  for training and 100 images for validation, with the dimesions of 256 x 256. The anime images are 
  sourced from Anime-Planet1.
This dataset was used in: 
- U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization 
  for Image-to-Image Translation (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1907.10830)

2. CUFS (CUHK Face Sketch Database) dataset
Description:
- This dataset includes 188 faces from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) student database, 
  123 faces from the AR database, and 295 faces from the XM2VTS database, totalinf\g 606 faces. 
  Each face includes a sketch drawn by an artist based on a photo taken in a frontal pose, 
  under normal lighting condition and with a neutral expression.
This dataset was used in: 
- Face Photo-Sketch Synthesis and Recognition (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4624272)
- High-Quality Facial Photo-Sketch Synthesis Using Multi-Adversarial Networks 
  (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10182.pdf)

3. CelebA dataset
Description: 
- The CelebA dataset consists of more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute 
annotations. The images in this dataset cover large pose variations and background clutter.
This dataset was used in: 
- Facial attribute-controlled sketch-to-image translation with generative adversarial 
  networks (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13640-020-0489-5)
